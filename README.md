Most of my music, usually in .wav and .mmpz (lmms source) form. No promises it sounds good.

I will not stop you from using anything in here for any private purpose.
Public purposes should properly accredited to "Gwabba Waba". Credit may either be contained within the work or otherwise be easily accessible. If you really don't want to credit me, send me an email with a gift card for Amazon or Taco Bell, if it's like $1 or more I won't give you any fuss.
If I find people refusing to follow these guides it will result in this repo no longer being publicly updated, don't ruin it.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email.
